    <h1>THE NERVO SISTERS</h1>
    
    <p>From songwriters to artists and super-fans to superstars, electronic dance music’s first sisters – <em>Mim</em> and <em>Liv Nervo</em> of NERVO – have staged a miraculous climb onto the international stage, straight from the pit in front of it.</p>

    <p>These multi talented DJ dynamos are the all-time top-ranking female DJs in the world, voted by their legions of fans to #16 on DJ Magazine’s influential 2013 <strong>Top 100 DJs</strong> poll. In-demand and beloved across the globe, their nonstop schedule takes them from the shimmering beaches of <em>Ibiza</em>, to their studio in their home-away-from-hometown of <em>London</em>, to the towering Main Stage of <em>Electric Daisy Carnival</em> in <em>Las Vegas</em>. And everywhere they go, their infectious energy, fearless personal style, and deep love and understanding for the music precedes them.</p>
